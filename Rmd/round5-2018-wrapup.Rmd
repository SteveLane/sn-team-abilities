No commentary this week, I'm in the US...

If you missed my round 5 predictions, [here they are]({{< relref "2018-05-25-round5.md" >}}).

## Wrap-up

```{r prediction-table}
preds <- readRDS(here("Rmd", "sn-assets", "round6-2018", "results_match.rds"))
knitr::kable(preds)

```

<!-- Is the model now hitting its stride? It gave the Vixens a 36% chance of winning, and unfortunately they went down to the Firebirds, who are looking quite strong. -->

<!-- The Fever were very slight favourites (56%) away from home, and they got the job done against the Lightning who rely do have a premiership hangover. -->

<!-- The Magpies were strong favourites (80%) against the Thunderbirds, and the result was a true thrashing. 20 goals the difference, poor ol' Thunderbirds, looks like another year of dwelling in the cellar. -->

<!-- The final game of the round saw the Swifts beat the Giants. The Giants were hotly fancied by the model (79%), but in a close game, the Swifts got the job done. -->
