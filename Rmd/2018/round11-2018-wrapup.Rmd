The Lightning were heavy model favourites this time around, and managed to scrape in with a two point win over the weekend. The Giants had been preferred by the model, but the Firebirds proved too strong at home. Ridiculously, the model gave the Vixens a 100% chance of winning---whilst they did win, 100% is a bit much!

Congratulations to Tegan Philip on 100 games!

## Wrap-up

If you missed my round 11 predictions, [here they are]({{< relref "2018-07-12-round11.md" >}}).

```{r prediction-table}
preds <- readRDS(here("Rmd", "sn-assets", "round12-2018", "results_match.rds"))
knitr::kable(preds)

```

## Team Abilities

Ability is starting to be predicted a little more consistently; the Fever are going well, as are the Giants and the Vixens.

ladder <- readRDS(here("Rmd", "sn-assets", "round12-2018", "ladder.rds"))
knitr::kable(ladder)

```
